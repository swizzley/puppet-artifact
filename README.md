## Overviw

This module is designed to download artifacts using curl, the key feature is the ability to update artifacts from a source if they are different. It uses curl because it doesn't usually need installed. For refreshing services dependant on these artifacts... which is why this module was developed relies heavily on meta parameters, require, subscribe, before, notify, and for triggering external checks the exec refreshonly bool. As of version 0.2.x this module adds a new bash script called /usr/local/sbin/artifact-puppet, this bash script is more efficient and reliable because it does a test based on file size before downloading, and then confirms the size matches before overriding the working file with the swap file, else it prints a download error, or skips the download entirely which only applies to the ```update => true``` parameter. 

## Setup

```puppet module install swizzley88-artifact```

## Paramaeters

  * $source   https://some_url.jar ```[required]```
  * $target   /some/local/dir ```[required]```
  * $update   override with newer ```[default: false]```
  * $rename   rename the downloaded file ```[default: undef]```
  * $purge    replace the target (alternative to updating) ```[default: false]```
  * $swap     /download/dir ```[default: /tmp]```
  * $timeout  exit after $x seconds ```[default: 0]```
  * $owner    uid owner of file ```[default: undef]```
  * $group    gid owner of file ```[default: undef]```
  * $mode     default permissions mode of file ```[default: undef]```
  * $validate default method to validate file ```[default: size]```
  * $modified file modified elswhere in puppet ```[default: false]```

## Usage

```
artifact { 'artifact.war': 
  source   => 'http://example.com/pub/artifact.war', 
  target   => '/home/tomcat/webapps', 
  swap     => '/home/tomcat/tmp',
  purge    => true,
  update   => false,
  timeoute => 60,
  owner    => 'tomcat',
  group    => 'tomcat',
  mode     => '0640',
  before   => File['/home/tomcat/conf/artifact.properties'],
  notify   => Service['tomcat'],
}
```

```
artifact { "artifact-${version}-${build}.war": 
  source  => "http://example.com/pub/artifact-${version}-${build}.war", 
  target  => '/home/tomcat/webapps', 
  update  => true,
}
```

Command-Line usage of /usr/local/sbin/artifact-puppet:

```
/usr/local/sbin/artifact-puppet /opt/wordpress.tar.gz https://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz /tmp/wordpress.tar.gz size false
```

This will only compare if ARG1's size isn't the same as ARG2 and download it to ARG3, it only touches ARG1 & ARG3 if they don't exist.

## Requirements

```
package { ['curl', 'diffutils', 'grep', 'dos2unix', 'md5sum']: ensure => 'installed' }
```

## Compatibility

Linux:

 * RHEL/CentOS/Fedora/Oracle/Scientific
 * Debian/Ubuntu
 
Tested On: CentOS 6, Ubuntu 14.04

## Limitations

Comparison operations are limited to diff for version <= 0.1.x, and to file size as of >= 0.2.x <= 0.3.0

**WARNING**: As of  >= 0.2.8 File permissions are declared in this module, so the users declaring those permissions externally should use version <= 0.1.4

**WARNING**: Resume functionality in 0.2.6 can lead to corruption for artifacts that change before an interrupted download resumes, resume now deprecated as of >= 0.2.7

**WARNING**: As of >=0.3.0 the legacy update parameter has been deprecated, if using ```legacy => ``` anywhere, stick to version >= 0.2.0 <= 0.2.8

## Development

  * Add support for checksum params
  * Perhaps add additional OS support
